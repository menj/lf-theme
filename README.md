## Troubleshooting

### URLs Not Working / 404 Errors / Permalink Issues

**This is the issue you experienced!**

**Solution:**
1. Go to **Settings > Permalinks**
2. Click **Save Changes**
3. This flushes rewrite rules and fixes custom post type URLs

The theme now includes automatic permalink flushing on activation, but you may need to manually flush once after first install.

### URL Conflict with Existing Category

**If you have an existing category at `/books/`:**

The theme now uses `/publications/` for the custom post type to avoid conflicts.

- Your category: `https://yoursite.com/books/` ✅
- Book archive: `https://yoursite.com/publications/` ✅

**After installation:**
1. Flush permalinks (Settings > Permalinks > Save)
2. Update menu links if needed

See `URL-CONFLICT-FIX.txt` for detailed information.

### Parent Theme Not Found Error

**Solution:**
1. Make sure Twenty Twenty-Five is installed
2. Go to **Appearance > Themes**
3. Install Twenty Twenty-Five if missing
4. Don't activate parent - activate child theme only

### Styles Not Loading

**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Clear WordPress cache (if using cache plugin)
3. Check that both parent and child themes are properly installed

### Book Pages Return 404

**Solution:** Same as permalink fix above - flush permalinks.

## Why Child Theme Fixes URL Issues

The previous standalone theme was registering custom post types which can override WordPress URL settings. As a child theme:

1. **Proper Rewrite Rules:** The theme now includes `'with_front' => false` in CPT registration
2. **Automatic Flush:** Permalink rules flush automatically on theme activation
3. **Better Integration:** Child themes integrate better with WordPress core
4. **Cleaner Inheritance:** Leverages Twenty Twenty-Five's solid foundation

## Customization

### Changing Colors

Edit `/css/main.css`:

```css
:root {
    --color-primary: #6B5B4A;
    --color-accent: #C9A961;
}
```

### Changing Fonts

Edit `/css/main.css`:

```css
